# SpatialTranscriptomic
Spatial profiling defines differentially expressed genes comparing between two groups. My samples were tissues which area of the different cells were identified and performed in situ library hybridization. Later whole transciptomic sequencing was performed.
This code is used for create R object and grouping the different types of cells. Then, gene expression of each group were compared and the significantly expressed gene were identified leading to predict the novel mechanism in the model

Application:
Single cell sequencing analysis
